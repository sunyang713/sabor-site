          Auditions occur semesterly, typically on a Tuesday at 10pm, and take about two hours. The process is split into three sections:

          <ol>
            <li>Salsa: Basic footwork instruction followed by a partnerwork routine.</li>
            <li>Bachata: Basic footwork instruction followed by a partnerwork routine.</li>
            <li>???: Solo routine in a surprise dance category.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        Each section is taught step-by-step for 25 minutes. After the three sections have been taught, you will perform the routines in small groups for the team. You will receive an email later that evening stating whether you have been selected for callbacks or not.

        Callbacks take place the next night starting 10pm again. There will be a quick review of the routines at the beginning. Then in groups of two or three, you will perform the routines again, this time dancing with members of the team. Each person will also be asked to show off a talent - prepare something that shows off who you are!

        <p>
          Auditions are fast-paced and intense, but not intimidating. Part of the test is working with the pressure and intensity of picking up choreography quickly and demonstrating your musicality, stage presence, and technique. You are not expected to know anything beforehnad - we assume zero-knowledge at the beginning. Many of our dancers joined the team without prior experience.
